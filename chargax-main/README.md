## 📦 Installation

For those using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), it is possible to run a standard PPO implementation with default settings by directly running `uv run main.py`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ponseko/chargax.git
cd chargax
uv run main.py
```

Alternatively, install the project as an editable package in your favourite virtual environment software. E.g. using conda:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ponseko/chargax.git
cd chargax
conda create -n chargax python=3.11
conda activate chargax
pip install -e .

python main.py
```

for CUDA support, additionally run `pip install jax[cuda]`.

> [!NOTE]
> The PPO implementation used in the example `train.py` file is different from the one
> used in the paper. As such, required hyperparameters may be different as well.
> Check out the submission branch to reproduce results.
